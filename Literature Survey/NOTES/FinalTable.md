|International Truck Routing Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning|Taufik Nur Adi, Yelita Anggiane Iskandar and Hyerim Bae|13 October 2020|DQN (Deep Q Network - combination of RL and a convolutional neural network),SA,Tabu search|-|DQN can quickly adapt to the environment. Compared to SA and TS, DQN is faster.|DQN does not show better results across all datasets.Another issue is the development of a stable DQN that requires less training data and training time, but can a provide a feasible solution for the general cases.|
