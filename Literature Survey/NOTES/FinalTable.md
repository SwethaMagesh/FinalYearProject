|Innovation Mode and Optimization Strategy of B2C E-Commerce Logistics Distribution under Big Data|Yingyan Zhao 1, Yihong Zhou 2 and Wu Deng 3,*|21 April 2020|COHADOOP (ECLHADOOP), big data mining methods|- |development of logistics enterprises and reduce the cost of B2C e-commerce logistics distribution, improved eciency and service quality of logistics enterprises and enhance the competitiveness, which further promote the economy development.|-|
|International Truck Routing Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning|Taufik Nur Adi, Yelita Anggiane Iskandar and Hyerim Bae|13 October 2020|DQN (Deep Q Network - combination of RL and a convolutional neural network),SA,Tabu search|-|DQN can quickly adapt to the environment. Compared to SA and TS, DQN is faster.|DQN does not show better results across all datasets.Another issue is the development of a stable DQN that requires less training data and training time, but can a provide a feasible solution for the general cases.|
|Route Optimization in logistics distribution based on Particle Swarm Optimization|Appiah Martinson Yeboah, Xiong Qiang|30 July 2019|Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)|- |PSO has stronger function extreme value optimization ability so it provides the value which is close to actual optimal function value. When population size is increased, results were faster and better.|Certain parameters were not considered like loading and unloading time,real-time constraints.|
|Route planning model of multi-agent system for a supply chain management|Mortaza Zolfpour-Arokhlo, Ali Selamat â‡‘, Siti Zaiton Mohd Hashim|2013|RPA using MAS|Used some real time data|shows optimized result by reviewing agent applications. Novelty - using MAS in RPS to solve, results in suitable answers to complex transportation network problems.|-|
