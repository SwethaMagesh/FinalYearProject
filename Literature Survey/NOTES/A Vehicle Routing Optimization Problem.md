# A Vehicle Routing Optimization Problem

- A central depot with a no of transport vehicles.
- Set of customers to be served.
- ***Main Purpose*** - Find an optimal solution considering the factors (cost,customer satisfaction,environment).
---

## Assumptions made:

- Only one type of truck
- Locations are known (both depot and customer)
- Once distribution tasks are completed, all trucks must return to the depot
- Customer satisfied => vehicle arrives within time window

---

Result:
- mininum of operational costs
- maximum of customer satisfaction

**Cost-Effective fn** = min(sum(operational costs))/Average customer satisfaction

ACS=proportion of fully satisfied customers to total no of customers.
