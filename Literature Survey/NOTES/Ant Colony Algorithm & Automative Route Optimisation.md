ANT COLONY ALGORITHM:
- is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants
-  which consists of the fixed cost, fuel cost, carbon emissions cost, time window penalty cost and freshness decline penalty cost.

AUTOMATIVE ROUTE OPTIMISATION: 
- To properly display the problem, it could be better described as a network consisting of nodes connected by lines. In route planning scenarios, the nodes are customer destinations and depots, while the lines represent the roads between the nodes (Berhan. E et. al, 2014). Each road is affected by certain parameters and constraints that are either known or unknown, which will be described later in the chapter. From a central unit or depot, vehicles with certain limitations are 
dispatched on the roads to fulfill the customer demands at each customer destination (Berhan. E et. al, 2014). As mentioned before, the objective becomes to gather all the roads into a optimal route, which considers certain elements and constraints, for the vehicles to complete at the lowest 
cost possible.
