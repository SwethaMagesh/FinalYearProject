# Introduction

- divided into LRP(location routing problem) and WLP(warehouse location problem).

---

## Factors considered

- Freight cost from production facilities to customers
- storage cost for storing goods in warehouses
- cost for opening new warehouses

---

## Methodology and Framework

1. Customer space
    - Direct strategy - shipping goods from production to customers
    - Indirect strategy - delivers goods to external warehouse and then to customers
